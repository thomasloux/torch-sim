"""Wrapper for metatomic-based models in TorchSim.

This module provides a TorchSim wrapper of metatomic models for computing
energies, forces, and stresses for atomistic systems, including batched computations
for multiple systems simultaneously.

The MetatomicModel class adapts metatomic models to the ModelInterface protocol,
allowing them to be used within the broader torch-sim simulation framework.

Notes:
    This module depends on the metatomic-torch package.
