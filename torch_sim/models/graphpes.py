"""An interface for using arbitrary GraphPESModels in ts.

This module provides a TorchSim wrapper of the GraphPES models for computing
energies, forces, and stresses of atomistic systems. It serves as a wrapper around
the graph_pes library, integrating it with the torch-sim framework to enable seamless
simulation of atomistic systems with machine learning potentials.

The GraphPESWrapper class adapts GraphPESModels to the ModelInterface protocol,
allowing them to be used within the broader torch-sim simulation framework.

Notes:
    This implementation requires graph_pes to be installed and accessible.
    It supports various model configurations through model instances or model paths.
