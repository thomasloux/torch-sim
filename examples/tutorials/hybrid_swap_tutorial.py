# Implementing New Methods

This tutorial demonstrates how to combine different TorchSim components to implement new
simulation methods. We'll implement a hybrid Monte Carlo method that alternates between:
- Molecular dynamics (MD) for local exploration
- Swap Monte Carlo for composition changes

This is an advanced tutorial that will cover:
- Creating custom state objects
- Combining different TorchSim integrators
- Implementing hybrid simulation methods

## Setting up the Environment

First, let's set up our simulation environment and load a model. We'll use MACE
for this example, but any TorchSim compatible model would work.

For this example, we'll create a binary Cu-Zr alloy structure. We use pymatgen's

## Implementing the Hybrid Method

Our hybrid method requires a custom state object that combines properties from both
MD and Monte Carlo states. In TorchSim, we can create this by inheriting from the
MDState class and adding our Monte Carlo-specific attributes.

The key components we'll combine are:
1. NVT Langevin dynamics for local structure exploration
2. Swap Monte Carlo for jumps in configurational space

## Running the Hybrid Simulation

We'll run our hybrid simulation by alternating between MD and MC moves:
- Every 10 steps, we attempt a swap Monte Carlo move
- All other steps, we perform standard NVT dynamics

This creates a simulation that can both:
- Explore local energy minima through MD
- Make larger compositional changes through swap moves
